This preprint proposes topological catalysis of the proton-boron-11 (p-¹¹B) aneutronic fusion reaction using the primordial anyonic phase from the three-leaf clover (trefoil) knot in the TET–CVTL framework.

The reaction p + ¹¹B → 3⁴He + 8.7 MeV is clean (99.9% aneutronic) and fuel-abundant, but hindered by a high Coulomb barrier (Z=5 for boron). The trefoil braiding phase θ = 6π/5 induces constructive interference in the tunneling wavefunction, predicting a 20–40× rate enhancement at energies 100–500 keV in ultraclean laser-plasma or BEC environments.

Open QuTiP simulations, experimental guidelines, and characteristics of p-¹¹B fusion are provided.
